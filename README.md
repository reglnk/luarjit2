OpenResty luajit2 is a derivative of LuaJIT with improved API and other useful changes.
For OpenResty luajit2 documentation, please refer to

 luajit2.md		(the content is left unchanged as for https://github.com/openresty/luajit2)

luarjit2 is built ontop of that all, adding new syntax and thus being an implementation of a Lua-like language.
LuarJIT is the previous implementation of that language ontop of official LuaJIT.
